This library is based on the original image classification demo script and related API provided by tensorflow/Google.
We rewrote the original python script to provide a clean and easy-to-use interface for python API call. 
The use of FLAGS utility packaged in tensorflow library (FLAGS = tf.app.flags.FLAGS) was discarded to support a better intergration with
a web-server and similar production environment.
